## ðŸ”¹ Projects

### 1. **Car Game**
A simple car simulation game using OpenCV for graphics and controls.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 2. **Color Detection**
Detect and track specific colors in real-time using your webcam.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 3. **Detecting Clicks**
Detect and respond to mouse clicks on images or video frames.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 4. **Face Anonymizer**
Automatically blur or pixelate faces in images or videos to anonymize them.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 5. **Face Detection (cvzone)**
Detect faces in real-time using the **cvzone** library for more efficient tracking.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, cvzone  

### 6. **Hand Tracking**
Track hand movements and gestures in real-time using OpenCV.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 7. **Invisible Cloak**
Create an "invisibility effect" by masking a cloak of a specific color in video streams.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV  

### 8. **Motion Detection**
Detect motion in video streams for security or monitoring applications.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV
